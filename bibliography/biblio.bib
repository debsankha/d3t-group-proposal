  abstract = {In a dynamic dial-a-ride problem (DARP) the task is to provide a transportation service in a given area by dynamically routing a set of vehicles in response to passengers’ trip requests. Passengers share vehicles similarly as with buses, while the schedule and routes are chosen ad hoc. Each trip is defined by the origin-destination pair in plane augmented with a latest feasible delivery time. Optimal control of such a system is a complicated task in general and outside the scope of this paper. Instead, we consider a set of well-defined heuristic control policies that can be evaluated by means of simulations. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold: (i) to demonstrate that a phenomenon known as congestive collapse occurs as the rate of trip requests increases beyond a capacity threshold of the given control policy (the value of which itself is unknown a priori); (ii) to propose a robust and computationally lightweight countermeasure to avoid the congestive collapse in such a way that the system’s performance still improves after the capacity threshold has been passed. Despite its appealing simplicity, the proposed method succeeds in rejecting customers detrimental for the common good.},

  abstract = {Demand-responsive transport is a form of public transport between bus and taxi services, involving flexible routing of small or medium sized vehicles. This dissertation presents mathematical models for demand-responsive transport and methods that can be used to solve combinatorial problems related to vehicle routing and journey planning in a transport network. Public transport can be viewed as a market where demand affects supply and vice versa. In the first part of the dissertation related to vehicle routing, we show how a given demand for transportation can be satisfied by using a fleet of vehicles, assuming that the demand is known at the individual level. In the second part, by considering the journey planning problem faced by commuters, we study how the demand adapts to the supply of transport services, assuming that the supply remains unchanged for a short period of time. We also present a stochastic network model for determining the economic equilibrium, that is, the point at which the demand meets the supply, by assuming that commuters attempt to minimize travel time and transport operators aim to maximize profit. The mathematical models proposed in this work can be used to simulate the operations of public transport services in a wide range of scenarios, from paratransit services for the elderly and disabled to large-scale demand-responsive transport services designed to compete with private car traffic. Such calculations can provide valuable information to public authorities and planners of transportation services, regarding, for example, regulation and investments. In addition to public transport, potential applications of the proposed methods for solving vehicle routing and journey planning problems include freight transportation, courier and food delivery services, military logistics and air traffic.},

  abstract = {Taxi services are a vital part of urban transportation, and a considerable contributor to traffic congestion and air pollution causing substantial adverse effects on human health. Sharing taxi trips is a possible way of reducing the negative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense of passenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due to computational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached on small scales, such as within airport perimeters, or with dynamical ad hoc heuristics. However, a mathematical framework for the systematic understanding of the tradeoff between collective benefits of sharing and individual passenger discomfort is lacking. Here we introduce the notion of shareability network, which allows us to model the collective benefits of sharing as a function of passenger inconvenience, and to efficiently compute optimal sharing strategies on massive datasets. We apply this framework to a dataset of millions of taxi trips taken in New York City, showing that with increasing but still relatively low passenger discomfort, cumulative trip length can be cut by 40\% or more. This benefit comes with reductions in service cost, emissions, and with split fares, hinting toward a wide passenger acceptance of such a shared service. Simulation of a realistic online system demonstrates the feasibility of a shareable taxi service in New York City. Shareability as a function of trip density saturates fast, suggesting effectiveness of the taxi sharing system also in cities with much sparser taxi fleets or when willingness to share is low.},

One of their most significant achievements was a deeper understanding of the phase transition from the uncongested to the congested phase at a critical traffic load on uncorrelated networks. In this paper, we also study phase transition in transportation networks using a discrete time random walk model. Our aim is to establish a direct connection between the structure of an uncorrelated random graph with quenched disorder and the value of the critical traffic load. We show that if the network is dense, the quenched and annealed formulas for the critical loading probability coincide. For sparse graphs, higher-order corrections, related to the local structure of the network, appear.},

Compared with the shortest path routing strategy depending on central nodes largely and the efficient routing strategy avoiding hub routers as much as possible, the probability routing strategy makes use of hub routers more efficiently, transferring approximate average amount of packs of the whole network. Simulation results indicate that the probability routing strategy has the highest network capacity among the three routing strategies. This strategy provides network capacity that can be more than 30 times higher than that of the shortest path routing strategy and over 50\% higher than that of the efficient routing strategy. In addition, the average routing path length of our proposed strategy is over 10\% shorter than that of the efficient routing strategy and only about 10\% longer than that of the shortest path routing strategy.},

In this paper, we focus our research on traffic dynamics of a spatial scale-free network with the restriction of bandwidth proportional to link Euclidean distance, and a new routing strategy is proposed with consideration of both Euclidean distance and betweenness centralities (BC) of edges. It is found that compared with the shortest distance path (SDP) strategy and the minimum betweenness centralities (MBC) of links strategy, our strategy under some parameters can effectively balance the traffic load and avoid excessive traveling distance which can improve the spatial network capacity and some system behaviors reflecting transportation efficiency, such as average packets traveling time, average packets waiting time and system throughput, traffic load and so on. Besides, though the restriction of bandwidth can trigger congestion, the proposed routing strategy always has the best performance no matter what bandwidth becomes. These results can provide insights for research on real networked traffic systems.},

This paper builds on a more realistic traffic flow model, and offers a holistic view on the network designing problem. In addition to the extensively studied transmission capacity, this paper takes designing cost and scalability as two other designing objectives, and presents a quantitative study of how different designing choices independently and collectively influence these objectives by the introduction of a cartesian coordinate system. It is shown that different kinds of network topologies display different shapes of achievable solution spaces and exhibit different abilities to achieve cost-effective and scalable designing. In particular, we find the philosophy underlying empirical network designing and engineering today fails to meet the cost-effective and scalable designing requirements, and propose a cost-effective and scalable designing scheme for BA-like networks, i.e., the efficient routing combined with effective betweenness based link bandwidth allocation. In addition, when designing a thoroughly new network from the beginning, we find that ER network is a good candidate to achieve cost-effective and scalable designing in most settings.},

At the critical point the behavior of the model is totally independent of the number of hierarchical levels. Also scaling properties are observed when the size of the system varies.
