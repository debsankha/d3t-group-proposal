\section*{Introduction}
Demand-Driven Directed Transport (D3T) is an approach to improve upon issues that touch us in a daily basis. Therefore, our main motivation is
{\bf Application inspired basic research}. We will attempt to answer, both qualitatively and quantitatively (depending on the question), whether 
\emph{a solution is appropriate for the system at hand}. We will draw on the tools of modeling, obtain real world data, and validate them continuously. 
Aspects like scalability and resilience would be given utmost attention. 

We will, however, also strive to investigate universal phenomena so long as our model remains as applicable to the system.
