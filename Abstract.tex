Transport of both people and goods are fundamental pillars of our highly interconnected globalized society. Unfortunately, it is also one of the biggest contributor to CO2 emission \cite{ipcc2014}. On demand shared transport systems have the potential to be more efficient, resilient and sustainable than
classical transport schemes. Demand-driven directed transport (D3T) aims to be a unifying framework for implementing, evaluating and comparing different aspects of this problem.
