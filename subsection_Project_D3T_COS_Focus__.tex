\subsection*{Project D3T-COS (Focus on Computation & Software)}
This project will be responsible for making sure that the inputs from the other four 
work smoothly. It will ensure that the software developed will be
\begin{itemize}
\item Well designed (modular, extensible) from the beginning.
\item Well documented throughout.
\item Tested in automated manner. 
\item Continuously integrated.
\end{itemize}

Some of the concrete implementation tasks facing the COS team will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing the models built by DYN. 
\item Implementing statistical model validation tests designed by DYN.
\item Implementing routing \cite{guan_efficient_2013, zhang_probability_2013} and sharing \cite{santi_quantifying_2014} strategies. 
\item Simulated testing of the output of OPT. 
\end{itemize}
This goals will, of course, change continuously.
