\subsection*{Project D3T-COS (Focus on Computation & Software)}
In tandem with the building of models undertaken by D3T-DYN, we have to answer the questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing the models built by DYN. 
\item Implementing statistical model validation tests designed by DYN.
\item Implementing routing \cite{guan_efficient_2013, zhang_probability_2013} and sharing \cite{santi_quantifying_2014} strategies. 
\item Simulated testing of the output of OPT. 
\end{itemize}
