Once we have the models, strategies and their implementations in place, we would need to go about the task of tuning them.
Questions include
\begin{itemize}
\item What criteria to optimize for?
\item What algorithms to choose for such optimization? Heuristics, annealing, genetic algorithms...
\item Do these algorithms scale to large volumes?
\end{itemize}
